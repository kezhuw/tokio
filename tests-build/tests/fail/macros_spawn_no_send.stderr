   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future created by async block is not `Send`

   = help: within `[async block@$DIR/tests/fail/macros_spawn_no_send.rs:13:1: 13:29]`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<i32>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |              ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `_value` maybe used later
